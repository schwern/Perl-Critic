[0.22] Released on ????-??-??

     New Policies:
     * TestingAndDebugging::ProhibitProlongedStrictureOverride
     * ControlStructures::ProhibitMutatingListFunctions

     New Features:
     * Say "perlcritic -List" to get an expanded listing of all Policies.
       The format is suitable for use as your .perlcriticrc file.
     * Say "perlcritic -doc PATTERN" to get the documentation for all
       Policies that match m/PATTERN/imx.  This is a little easier than
       typing in the full name of the Policy module with "perldoc".

     Bug Fixes:
     * 21713 false positive for parens used with substr and unpack.
     * 22890 allow Rcs keywords in POD.

[0.21]  Released on 2006-11-05

     New Policies:
     * BuiltinFunctions::ProhibitReverseSortBlock
     * BuiltinFunctions::ProhibitVoidGrep
     * BuiltinFunctions::ProhibitVoidMap
     * CodeLayout::RequireConsistentNewlines
     * Modules::RequireFilenameMatchesPackage
     * TestingAndDebugging::RequireTestLabels
     * ValuesAndExpressions::ProhibitMismatchedOperators

     New Features:
     * Introduced policy "themes."  Themes are arbitrary names that can
       be used to identify a group of related Policies.  You can select
       your favorite policies by combining themes in a mathematic expression
       such as "pbp * (danger + risky)".  See POD for details. 
     * perlcritic output is colorized if you have Term::ANSIColor.  This
       only works on non-Win32 platforms.  Use -nocolor switch to disable.
     * Say "perlcritic -count" to get just the the total number of
       violations per file.  Use this feature to quickly identify hot-spots.
     * Use the -only switch to choose only from policies mentioned in your
       .perlcriticrc file.  This is useful if you usually only want to
       work with a small subset of the policies.
     * Default values for most of the perlcritic and Perl::Critic options
       can now be defined in your .perlcriticrc file.  See POD for details.

     Bug Fixes:
     * 21236: wrong page number for "printing to filehandles"
     * 21916: File handle ... wrong page reference in PBP [DUPE]
     * 21714: false positive for capture var used in ternary condition
     * 21718: No skip for File::Slurp in includes.t
     * ProhibitBarewordFilehandles doesn't complain if you open
       STDIN, STDOUT or STDERR.
     * Parrot 40564: Subroutines::RequireFinalReturn should allow die,
       exit, etc.
     * Each "for" and "foreach" loop now adds one point to the McCabe
       complexity score.

     Other Stuff:
     * The internals of Perl::Critic have been significantly refactored,
       but should still be compatible with existing third-party Policies.
     * Added author-only tests to the release, but disabled by default
     * New Perl::Critic::Utils::shebang_line() method
     * Support for filename-based policies
     * Additional prerequisite: Set::Scalar
     * Now requires PPI version 1.118

[0.20]  Released on 2006-09-10

     Perl::Critic now requires PPI version 1.117, which fixes
     several bugs that were introduced in version 1.116.

     Bug Fixes:
     * 21079: grep clears @SITE_POLICIES
     * 21352: Test failures with PPI 1.117
     * 11365: sub DESTROY detected as a builtin homonym

[0.19]  Released on 2006-08-20

     New Policies:
     * BuiltinFunctions::ProhibitStringySplit
     * ControlStructures::ProhibitDeepNests
     * RegularExpressions::ProhibitCaptureWithoutTest
     * Variables::RequireLexicalLoopIterator

     New Features:
     * "perlcritic -quiet" suppresses the "source OK" message.
     * Variables::ProhibitPunctuationVars is now configurable.

     Bug Fixes:
     * 20965: "Hard tabs used at" shouldn't check __DATA__
     * 21070: ProhibitNoisyQuotes hates overload
     * Punctuation variables are now exempt from ProhibitLocalVars

     Other Stuff:
     * Test coverage is now over 95%

[0.18_01]  Released on 2006-08-06

     New Policies:
     * Variables::RequireNegativeIndices
     * InputOutput::ProhibitInteractiveTest
     * ErrorHandling::RequireCarping

     Bug Fixes:
     * RequireTidyCode tests fail if user has custom .perltidyrc file
     * 20612: RequirePerlTidy was ignoring HEREDOCs
     * 20659: __END__ statement considered "unreachable"
     * Fix for PPI::XS (no C<use overload '""'> support)
     * Support for 'goto' in ProhibitAmpersandSigils and
       Subroutines::RequireFinalReturn

     Performance Enhancements:
     * Introduced Perl::Critic::Document class.  This is a facade for
       PPI::Document which internally caches search results.  This
       reduces the running time by about 35%.  The facade should be
       invisible, unless you are doing something really sneaky.
     * Extraction of the 'diagnostics' information is postponed
       until it is really needed.  Speedup has not been measured.
     * Calls to helper-subs have been reordered for maximum efficiency.

     Other Cool Stuff:
     * Includes updated version of perlcritic mode for emacs.  See
       "extras/perlcritic.el" for details.

[0.18]  Released on 2006-07-16

     Bug Fixes:
     * 14855: Home discovery is dangerously naive.
     * 20060: Incorrect page numbers in ProhibitLeadingZeros
       and RequireNumberSeparator policies.
     * 20068: .perlrc file - inconsistent documentation
     * 20254: "use vars qw(@EXPORT_OK)" not recognized
     * 20463: No-case heredoc terminator incorrectly detected as lower case.
     * ProhibitOneArgBless doesn't understand "bless {} => $class;"
     * ProhibitExcessComplexity doesn't count 'while' and 'until' stmnts
     * ProhibitLeadingZeros was falsely hits '.0456'

     Enhancements:
     * If File::HomeDir is available, we use it to locate the
       .perlcriticrc file.  This should help make Perl::Critic
       more portable to Win32 platforms.  If File::HomeDir is
       not installed, we resort to looking at the usual
       environment variables.

     Other Stuff:
     * Added "perlcritic.el", which is a super-cool emacs minor-mode
       that runs perl-critic on the current buffer and returns the
       results in a sexy hot-linked "compiler" window.  You can run
       it on demand, or have it run automatically every time you
       save the buffer.  You can find this in the extras/ directory.
       Thanks to Josh ben Jore for contributing this.

     * Moved "Perl::Critic::TestUtils" into the installed build.  This
       module is only used for unit-testing Perl::Critic, but we
       are putting it in the installation so folks who want to
       extend Perl::Critic can make use of it.

[0.17]  Released on 2006-06-13

     Bug Fixes:
     * 19836: Perl-Critic0.16 fails tests during install.  This was
       caused by a bug in version 3.01 of Module::Pluggable.  See
       http://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=19857 for details.
     * Fixed bug in no-critic pragma parser.

     New Policies:
     * ValuesAndExpressions::ProhibitEscapedCharacters
     * BuiltinFunctions::RequireSimpleSortBlock

     Enhancements:
     * Perl::Critic can export critique() as a static function.  This
       may appeal to folks who dislike the object-oriented interface.

[0.16]  Released on 2006-05-14

     Production release.

     Enhancements:
     * Perl::Critic->critique() now accepts a PPI::Document as the
       argument.  This feature creates an additional dependency on
       Scalar::Util, but that shouldn't be a problem because it is
       included with List::Util, which we already use.

     Miscellanea:
     * Increased PPI dependency from v1.110 to v1.112

[0.15_03] Released on 2006-05-07

     Bug Fixes:
     * The "## no critic" feature is now implemented without eval-ing
       the code.  This keeps Perl::Critic pure and safe :)
     * 19082: Page number for AUTOLOAD is incorrect

     New Policies:
     * ControlStructures::ProhibitUnreachableCode (by Peter Guzis)
     * Modules::ProhibitAutomaticExportation
     * ValuesAndExpressions::ProhibitVersionStrings

[0.15_02] Released on 2006-04-26

     Bug Fixes:
     * Reimplemented the '##no critic' pragmas to have effect on the
       line where the violation is reported, not on the line where
       the candidate element lives.  This is because some policies
       may report violations that are nowhere near the element that
       is being evaluated.
     * RequireUseStrict, RequireUseWarnings, and RequireExplcitPackage
       all emit violations for _every_ statement that violates the
       Policy.  This closes a loophole that allowed you to circumvent
       the Policy by using '## no critic' on just the first statement
       that violated the policy.
     * Fixed the workaround for the magic shebang that is inserted
       by EU::MM and M::B.  This had stopped working around version 13.
     * Fixed -noprofile option on 'perlcritic'.  This also had stopped
       working at some point.

[0.15_01] Released on 2006-04-16

     Enhancements:
     * Added diagnostic messages if the .perlcriticrc contains entries
       for Policy modules that don't seem to exist.
     * Now you can specify which policies to disable with the
       "## no critic" pseudo-pragmas.  This feature is still
       experimental.  See docs for details.
     * perlcritic's directory searching now skips backup files, such
       as *.swp, *.bak and *~.  It also ignores version control system
       directories, and the blib directory in module build directories.

     Bug Fixes:
     * 18386: Bad example in POD for Documentation::RequirePodSections
     * 18670: Test failure if Perl::Tidy is not installed 
     * 18698: Policy idea ProhibitUniversalFunctions (see New Policies)
     * RequireInterpolationOfMetachars falsely hit strings like 'foo=s@'
       which are commonly used with Getopt::Long.

     New Policies:
     * BuiltinFunctions::ProhibitUniversalCan (by Chris Dolan)
     * BuiltinFunctions::ProhibitUniversalIsa (by Chris Dolan)

     Miscellanea:
     * All spurrious options for `perlcritic` are now fatal.
     * Changed several of the -verbose formats to be more readable.
     * Explicit -severity option now overrides -[12345] shortcuts instead
       of being the other way around.



[0.15] Released on 2006-03-26

     Production release.

     Bug Fixes:
     * 17964: Insists my code is not tidy (may not be fixed for all cases)

[0.14_02] Released on 2006-03-19

     Bug Fixes:
     * 15653: False positive in OneArgSelect (fixed for real this time)

     New Policies:
     * ClassHierarchies::ProhibitAutoloading
     * Documentation::RequirePodSections
     * InputOutput::RequireBracedFileHandleWithPrint
     * ValuesAndExpressions::ProhibitMixedBooleanOperators
     * Variables::RequireInitializationForLocalVars

[0.14_01] Released on 2006-03-05

     Bug Fixes:
     * 14731: False positive: Builtin function called with parens
     * 17554: False positive in CodeLayout::RequireTrailingCommas

     New Policies:
     * ClassHierarchies::ProhibitExplicitISA
     * InputOutput::ProhibitReadlineInForLoop
     * Miscellanea::ProhibitFormats
     * Miscellanea::ProhibitTies
     * Variables::ProhibitConditionalDeclarations

[0.14] Released on 2006-01-29

     More documentation edits.

     New Policies:
     * Documentation::RequirePodAtEnd
     * Subroutines::ProtectPrivateSubs
     * Variables::ProhibitMatchVars
     * Variables::ProtectPrivateVars

     Bug Fixes:
     * 15295: "## no critic" pragmas too aggresive on compound statements.
     * t/01_config.t failed in the presence of third-party policies

[0.13_05] Not released

     More documentation edits.

     Implemented workaround for failing pod_coverage tests.

     Bug Fixes:
     * 16906:  tr/// created false-postives with RegularExpression polices.

[0.13_04] Released on 2005-12-31

     Moved DEVELOPER.pod file into the Perl/Critic dir.

     More documentation edits.

[0.13_03] Released on 20051230

     perlcritic now prints 'source OK' if it doesn't find any
     violations.  This gives folks a warm fuzzy feeling.

     Tweaked some test cases that were failing on my Solaris
     environment at work.

[0.13_02] Released on 2005-12-29

     Fixed Config to recognize fully-qualified module names in the
     .perlcriticrc file.

     Various documentation edits.

[0.13_01] Released on 2005-12-28

     Replaced 'priority' concept with 'severity'.  Now each Policy module
     has a predefined severity level ranging from 1 to 5.  By default,
     perlcritic only reports the most severe violations.  You can adjust
     the severity threshold at the command line, and you can change
     the severity for any Policy using the config file.

     Chris implemented the applies_to() mechanism, which allows each Policy
     class to declare the types of PPI elements that it wants to examine.
     When traversing the document, Perl::Critic invokes the Policy only
     for elements that are of the correct type.  This improves performance
     by about 33%.

     Perl::Critic now uses a Plugin architecture to automatically
     discover Policy modules.  So if you have custom Policies, all you
     have to do is install them in the Perl::Critic::Policy namespace --
     no need to add anything to your .perlcriticrc file.  If you write
     policies in a different namespace, you can configure that too.  See
     the Perl::Critic::Config docs for details.

     New Policies:
     * Modules::RequireEndWithOne
     * NamingConventions::ProhibitAmbiguousNames
     * References::ProhibitDoubleSigils
     * Subroutines::RequireFinalReturn
     * Subroutines::ProhibitAmpersandSigils
     * Subroutines::ProhibitExcessComplexity
     * TestingAndDebugging::ProhibitNoStrict
     * TestingAndDebugging::ProhibitNoWarnings

     Bug Fixes:
     * 15101: Plugin architecture improves support for 3rd-party code
     * 16319: Fixed incorrect PBP page number in ProhibitBarwordFilehandle
     * 16321: Lists of empty quotes are now allowed by ProhibitQuotedWordLists
     * 16288: Empty lists caused a fatal error RequireTrailingCommas
     * 15653: Fixed false positive in OneArgSelect.
     
[0.13] Released on 2005-10-31 

     Production release of 0.12_03.  No code major changes.

[0.12_03] Not released

     Renamed -Policy option to -include.  Added -exclude to give the
     opposite effect.

     Refactored constructor of Perl::Critic.  Now, most of the work
     is delegated to Perl::Critic::Config.  I'm not sure I like how
     this turned out, but we'll see how it goes.

     Renamed some Policy modules to be a bit more comprehensible.  Note
     that you may need to change your .perlcriticrc file accordingly. 
     I also suggest removing your current Perl::Critic installation 
     before installing this one.

     Name Changes:
     * ProhibitUnpackagedCode => RequireExplicitPackage
     * RequireQuotedWords     => ProhibitQuotedWordLists

     Improved error message when Perl::Critic dies because PPI can't
     parsee the input code.

     Changed output of -help to be more terse.

     Edited POD.

[0.12_02] Not released

     Added -Policy option to perlcritic.  The idea is to provide a 
     compact interface for selecting Policy modules at the command-line.
     This feature is experimental and subject to change.

     Added a warning message if -verbose value looks strange.  In most 
     applications, the -verbose option does not require a value, so people
     might be puzzled when they write 'perlcritic -verbose my_file.pm' and
     nothing seems to happen.

     Command-line options to perlcritic are now case-sensitive.  This
     makes it easier to abbreviate options that start with the same letters
     (e.g. 'Version' and 'verbose')

     Fixed the new Policy modules that were misnamed and misplaced in the 
     previous distribution.

[0.12_01] Not released

     Rewrote some of the ControlStructures and BuiltinFunction 
     policies to be simpler (and probably a little faster).

     Edited POD.  Fixed some typos.  Added PREREQUISITES section
     to Perl::Critic documentation.

     Fixed the -verbose FORMAT option so that you can put metachars
     in the FORMAT specification.  If using perlcritic, be careful to
     protect them from getting munged by the shell first.

     Replaced ProhibitRequireStatements with RequireBarewordIncludes
     module. Courtesy of Chris Dolan <cdolan@cpan.org>

     Added configuration to ProhibitInterpolationOfLiterals so that
     certain flavors of quotes can be exempt.  This is for folks who
     have configured their editor to use special syntax highlighting
     for certain kinds of strings (SQL, for example).

     perlcritic now accepts multiple file arguments, so now you can 
     critique your entire distribution in one shot.  As a result, the 
     output-formats have changed slightly.

     New Policy modules:
     * BuiltinFunctions::ProhibitLvalueSubstr
     * BuiltinFunctions::ProhibitSleepViaSelect
     * ClassHierarchies::ProhibitOneArgBless
     * CodeLayout::RequireTrailingCommas
     * CodeLayout::RequireQuotedWordLists
     * InputOutput::ProhibitTwoArgOpen
     * InputOutput::ProhibitOneArgSelect
     * InputOutput::ProhibitBarewordFileHandles
     * Miscellanea::RequireRcsKeywords
     * Modules::RequireVersionVar
     * RegularExpressions::RequireExtendedFormatting
     * RegularExpressions::RequireLineBoundaryMatching

     
     Bug fixes:
     14923: 'require' is now permitted. See RequireBarewordIncludes.
     15022: Fixed false-positives when keywords are used as hash keys.
     15023: Fixed spurious Violations by removing magic shebang.
     15031: Fixed spelling mistakes (and probably added some new ones).
     15233: Postfix 'if' is now allowed with 'die', 'croak', etc.

[0.12] Released 2005-10-10

     Redesigned the 'verbose' feature.  Now the output format 
     can be user-defined using a sprintf-like specification.
     perlciritc also has a predefined output format that is 
     compatible with grep mode in editors like vim and emacs.

     'return' is now exempt from ProhibitParensWithBuiltins.  I may
     extend this exemption to all unary functions.

     Edited POD. Added a super brief description of each policy 
     in the main Perl::Critic documentation.  Added details about
     editor integration.

     Additional Prerequisites:
     * String::Format

[0.11] Not released

     The internal dynamics and API of Perl::Critic have changed
     considerably.  The result is a 300% increase in performance.
     See the POD in Perl::Critic::Policy for details.

     New Features:
     * Added -verbose option to put more stuff in the output.  In the
       extreme, you can get the POD from Policy attached to each
       and every violation.

     Additional Prerequisites:
     * IO::String
     * Pod::PlainText

[0.10] Released 2005-10-05

     Fixed stupid bug in newest Policy modules.  They were returning
     PPI objects instead of Perl::Critic::Violation objects.  Doh!

     Fixed test scripts to prevent failures if the user already has a
     .perlcriticrc file.

     'ProhibitHardTabs' now allows leading tabs by default.

     Put the Changes file in reverse-chronological order, so the most
     recent stuff is easy to find at the top of the file

[0.09] Released 2005-10-04

     Fixed several bugs:
     * 14810: Now you are allowed to create your own 'import' function,
              since this is frequently done with fancy modules.
     * 14817: Parens, brackets, and braces are now excluded from
              'ProhibitNoisyQuotes' since they look better in quotes anyway.
     * 14787: $1..$9 and '_' are exempt from ProhibitPunctuationVars
     * 14899: Object methods with the same name as a built-in can
              be called with parens (ProhibitParensWithBuiltins).
     * 14901: Normalized the exit status of perlcritic to 0, 1, or 2.
              See documentation for explanation.
     * 14855: Partially fixed home directory discovery.  Still not
              completely portable, but at least doesn't create warnings.

     New features:
     * 14734: Limit for number separators is now configurable

     New Policy modules:
     * CodeLayout::ProhibitHardTabs
     * ControlStructures::ProhibitUnlessBlocks
     * ControlStructures::ProhibitUntilBlocks
     * ControlStructures::ProhibitCStyleForLoops

     Changed the syntax for the magic comments.  Adam had the
     idea of using a pragma-like notation.  I liked it.

[0.08_2] Released 2005-09-27

     Fixed problems with Perl::Critic::Config that caused File::Spec
     to emit 'uninitialized value' warnings during the build.

     Added 1 Policy module contributed by Graham TerMarsch

     Switched from File::Spec::Functions to plain File::Spec because
     I think its usage is more common.

     Removed 'FindBin' from the test files so I can be sure that the
     right libraries are getting loaded.  This means I'll have to
     use the -l option with C<prove>.

     Edited more POD.

[0.08_01] Not released

     Fixed "ProhibitParensWithBuiltins" to allow parens to be used with
     object method calls that have the same name as a builtin functions.

     Introduced magical comments that allow developers to configure 
     Perl::Critic on-the-fly from within their code.

     Added META.yml files and POD tests to the build.  I did this
     mostly just to boost the Kwalitee score on CPANTS.

     Switched from "Config::Std" to "Config::Tiny" because it doesn't
     require those fancy Damian modules that don't seem to work on
     some older versions of Perl.

[0.07] Released on 2005-09-21

     Fixed bugs in the ProhibitCascadingIfElse policy.  

     Added ProhibitExplicitReturnUndef policy

     Made ProhibitUnpackagedCode configurable so you can exempt scripts,
     which typically don't have an explicit 'package' statement.

     ProhibitPackageVars policy now exempts vars in ALL_CAPS.  This
     is to permit common package variables like @EXPORT and $VERSION.

     Renamed "ProhibitStringyGrep and "ProhibitStringyMap" because 
     the so-called string form doesn't really exist.  Now called
     "RequireBlockGrep" and "RequireBlockMap" 

     Corrected documentation on defining Policy names within the 
     configuration file.  This still isn't very clear and needs
     to be rewritten.

     Perl::Critic now requires PPI version 1.003, which has a few bug 
     fixes of its own.

     Rewrite some code just to make Perl::Critic more self-compliant.

     Added test cases to verify the configuration functionality.  These
     are not completely thorough and need more work.

[0.06] Released on 2005-09-17

     Now called 'Perl::Critic'.  

     Added 4 new policy modules.  
     
     Fixed bugs in build process.  

     Added support for Module::Build.

[0.05] Released on 2005-09-17

     End of 'Perl::Review' releases.  I have changed the name to
     'Perl::Critic' to avoid possible confusion with "The Perl Review"
     magazine.

[0.04] Released on 2005-09-14

     Version 0.03 was a bust because I uploaded the wrong tarball to PAUSE.

[0.03] Released on 2005-09-13.

     Major overhaul based on feedback from Perl community.

     Factored coding standards into separate modules (known as
     Policies).  The idea here is to allow other developers to easily
     contribute additional coding standards.

     Reworked Perl::Review into a simple engine for loading and running
     Policy modules.

     Gave perlreview a command-line interface and configuration file
     for selecting which Policy modules to use.
