=head1 NAME

Perl::Critic::Policy::RegularExpressions::RequireLineBoundaryMatching

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Folks coming from a C<sed> or C<awk> background tend to assume that
C<'$'> and C<'^'> match the beginning and and of the line, rather than
then beginning and ed of the string.  Adding the '/m' flag to your
regex makes it behave as most people expect it should.

  my $match = m{ ^ $pattern $ }x;  #not ok
  my $match = m{ ^ $pattern $ }xm; #ok

=head1 NOTES

For common regular expessions like e-mail addresses, phone numbers,
dates, etc., have a look at the L<Regex::Common> module.  Also, be
cautions about slapping modifier flags onto existing regular
expressions, as they can drastically alter their meaning.  See
L<http://www.perlmonks.org/?node_id=484238> for an interesting
discussion on the effects of blindly modifying regular expression
flags.
