=head1 NAME

Perl::Critic::Policy::CodeLayout::RequireTidyCode

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Conway does make specific recommendations for whitespace and
curly-braces in your code, but the most important thing is to adopt a
consistent layout, regardless of the specifics.  And the easiest way
to do that is to use L<Perl::Tidy>.  This policy will complain if
you're code hasn't been run through Perl::Tidy.

=head1 NOTES

Since L<Perl::Tidy> is not widely deployed, this is the only policy in
the L<Perl::Critic> distribution that is not enabled by default.  To
enable it, put this line in your F<.perlcriticrc> file:

 [CodeLayout::RequireTidyCode]
