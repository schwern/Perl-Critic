=head1 NAME

Perl::Critic::Policy::CodeLayout::RequireTrailingCommas

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Conway suggests that all elements in a multi-line list should be
separated by commas, including the last element.  This makes it a
little easier to re-order the list by cutting and pasting.

  my @list = ($foo, 
	      $bar, 
	      $baz);  #not ok
    
  my @list = ($foo, 
	      $bar, 
	      $baz,); #ok

=head1 NOTES

In the PPI parlance, a "list" is almost anything with parens.  I've
tried to make this Policy smart by targeting only "lists" that have at
least one element and are being assigned to something.  However, there
may be some edge cases that I haven't covered.  If you find one, send
me a note.
