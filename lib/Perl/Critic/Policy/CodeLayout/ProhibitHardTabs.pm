=head1 NAME

Perl::Critic::Policy::CodeLayout::ProhibitHardTabs

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Putting hard tabs in your source code (or POD) is one of the worst
things you can do to your co-workers and colleagues, especially if
those tabs are anywhere other than a leading position.  Because
various applications and devices represent tabs differnently, they can
cause you code to look vastly different to other people.  Any decent
editor can be configured to expand tabs into spaces.  L<Perl::Tidy>
also does this for you.  

This Policy catches all tabs in your source code, including POD, quotes,
and HEREDOCS.  However, tabs in a leading position are allowed.  If you want
to forbid all tabs everywhere, put this to your F<.perlcriticrc> file:

  [CodeLayout::ProhibitHardTabs]
  allow_leading_tabs = 0

Beware that Perl::Critic may report the location of the string that
contains the tab, not the actual location of the tab, so you may need
to do some hunting.  I'll try and fix this in the future.
