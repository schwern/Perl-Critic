=head1 NAME

Perl::Critic::Policy::CodeLayout::ProhibitQuotedWordLists

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Conway doesn't mention this, but I think C<qw()> is an underutilized
feature of Perl.  Whenever you need to declare a list of one-word
literals, the C<qw()> operator is wonderfully concise and saves you
lots of keystrokes.  And uusing C<qw()> makes it easy to add to the
list in the future.

  @list = ('foo', 'bar', 'baz');  #not ok
  @list = qw(foo bar baz);        #ok

=head1 CONSTRUCTOR

This Policy accepts an additional key-value pair in the constructor.
The key must be 'min_elements' and the value is the minimum number of
elements in the list.  Lists with fewer elements will be overlooked by
this Policy.  The default is 2.  Users of Perl::Critic can configure
this in their F<.perlcriticrc> file like this:

  [CodeLayout::ProhibitQuotedWordLists]
  min_elements = 4

=head1 NOTES

In the PPI parlance, a "list" is almost anything with parens.  I've
tried to make this Policy smart by targeting only "lists" that could
be sensibly expressed with C<qw()>.  However, there may be some edge
cases that I haven't covered.  If you find one, send me a note.

=head1 IMPORTANT CHANGES

This policy was formerly called "RequireQuotedWords" which seemed a
little counterintuitive.  If you get lots of "Cannot load policy
module" errors, then you probably need to change "RequireQuotedWords"
to "ProhibitQuotedWordLists" in your F<.perlcriticrc> file.
