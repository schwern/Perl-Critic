=head1 NAME

Perl::Critic::Policy::InputOutput::ProhibitBacktickOperators

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Backticks are super-convenient, especially for CGI programs, but I
find that they make a lot of noise by filling up STDERR with messages
when they fail.  I think its better to use IPC::Open3 to trap all the
output and let the application decide what to do with it.


  use IPC::Open3;

  @output = `some_command`;                      #not ok

  my ($writer, $reader, $err);
  open3($writer, $reader, $err, 'some_command'); #ok;
  @output = <$reader>;  #Output here
  @errors = <$err>;     #Errors here, instead of the console

=head1 NOTES

This policy also prohibits the generalized form of backticks seen as
C<qx{}>.
